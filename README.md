## Info

To run this you'll need to have Maven installed, which can be done by running `brew install maven` in the terminal assuming you have HomeBrew installed.

## Build Instructions

0. Ensure Maven is installed. You should be able to do this with a `brew install maven` as long as you have HomeBrew installed. Goolge around for htis.
1. Navigate to the root directory.
1. Run `./mvnw spring-boot:run` to compile and execute the program (NOTE: You might need to run a `./mvnw clean package` prior to running the actual application).
1. Visit the server at `localhost:8080`. To test if it's working, visit (or send a GET request via Postman to) `localhost:8080/test`. You should get the string `Looks like you're up and running!` back.
1. Good luck working!

## Cucumber Testing Setup

1. Navigate to `cucumber/features/dir/constants.rb
2. Replace the file path to match that of your machine

## Quick Notes

1. The entry point of this application is `Application.java` in `src/main/hava/hello`.
2. The routes and function calls exist in `Controller.java` in `src/main/hava/hello`.
3. Most work that needs to be done has been labeled with a `TODO:` tag -- searching for this might make your life easier.
