# Pair Programming Session Documentation

### Date: 04/12/19	
### Time: 6:30pm
### Location: USC Village

### Pair Names
Ankur and Andy

### Description of Tasks and Division of Labor
Ankur and Andy continued working on refactoring the image search API to use Bing. We switched out the old Google Images API with the new API in the normal flow and started making changes in the PriorSearch class to make the newly generated backend collages accessible from Firebase. The computation to produce these collages still needs to be completes.

_Note: Since this was a code refactoring and not a new feature implementation, the existing tests will be used with minor changes. These tests will be updated when the new search api is incorporated into the existing search endpoint flow._
