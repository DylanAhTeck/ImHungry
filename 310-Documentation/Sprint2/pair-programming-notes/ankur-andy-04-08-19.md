# Pair Programming Session Documentation

### Date: 04/08/19	
### Time: 5:30pm
### Location: JFF 4th Floor

### Pair Names
Ankur and Andy

### Description of Tasks and Division of Labor
Ankur and Andy explored different search APIs to use for making the transition to image processing on the backend. Ankur found the Bing Search API to work well, and they worked collaboratively to build a new function on the backend to use this new API. The function still needs to be incorporated into the existing search endpoint flow.

_Note: Since this was a code refactoring and not a new feature implementation, the existing tests will be used with minor changes. These tests will be updated when the new search api is incorporated into the existing search endpoint flow._
