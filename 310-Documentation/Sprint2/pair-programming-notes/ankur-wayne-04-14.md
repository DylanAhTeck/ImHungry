### Date: 04/14/19
### Time: 8:30pm
### Location: outside JFF

### Pair Names
Ankur Rastogi and Wayne Yu

Ankur and Wayne worked together to ensure that the new backend collage processing structure (storing in Google Cloud Storage) was easily accessible to the frontend. This involved adding a `collageURL` field to the JSON response to a search request that Wayne could easily access.

_Note: Since this was a code refactoring and not a new feature implementation, the existing tests will be used with minor changes. These tests will be updated when the new search api is incorporated into the existing search endpoint flow._
