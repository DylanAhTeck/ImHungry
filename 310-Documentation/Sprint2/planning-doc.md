## Why did we chose the subset of the product backlog to work on?

Our sprint backlog now includes all 8 features. We have separated the sprint into fixing features and new ones to be implemented. We decided to try to complete all 8 features by the end of Sprint 2 so that we can have all of Sprint 3 to fix any details that we have missed and make sure all requirements are satisifed. We decided to decompose each feature into the creation of test code and the implementation code for that feature. We also added a lock column on our sprint board that all implementation tasks will remain in until the test code for that feature is completed. We added cards for refactors as well. We decomposed the features that need to be fixed into development and testing tasks and moved those tasks back into the To-Do column.
