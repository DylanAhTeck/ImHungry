## Why did we chose the subset of the product backlog to work on?

The bulk of Sprint 3 will be focused on creating more and revising previous tests for existing features. In addition, we need to perform minor UI changes on the client side, specifically for pagination and ensuring consistency across various pages of the application. The To-Dos will continue to be flagged as "DEV" and "TEST" as seen in Sprint 2, and we will also be performing 4 refactors throughout the sprint.
