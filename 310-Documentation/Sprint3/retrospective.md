## What will be done to fix the sprint report?
The main area we need to improve on is pair programming sessions. The majority of the points deducted were from failure to set up Travis-CI. We had Tavis-CI installed but failed to make a .yml file. To fix this we already set up Travis-CI with our Github and added the .yml file. Now that it is properly running and also running our JUnit tests, we will put an emphasis as a team to make sure we screenshot the final Travis log from our pair programming sessions and will not finish a pair programming session until the logs are passing. We will also double check that all of our pair programming selfies work correctly.

## What will be done to fix features?

### Feature 2
We didn't recieve much feedback due to lack of tests. This sprint we are going to put a focus on tests. For feature 2, we are going to implement many more cucumber tests for maintaining information.

### Feature 3
We also need to create many more tests for this feature. We had a lack of JUnit tests which we plan to implement. We also need to make the pagination similar to Google's. We will use javascript on the frontend to make sure only relevant pages will show up on the pagination bar.

### Feature 4
We didn't receive any feedback due to lack of test code. For this reason we will be focusing on creating more cucumber tests as well as JUnit tests for prior searches.

### Feature 5
We need to make the UI more consistent. Therefore we will make the cards on the result page a standard height and width and all text in the background will be white. We also need to make sure that there is no overlapping text on the restaraunt details page.

### Feature 6
Need to create cucumber tests for adding ingredients to the grocery lists. We also will implement a feature that will check for duplicates and add the amount to the duplicate. We will also add a button on every page except the search page that takes you to the grocery lists page. We will also add a checkbox next to each ingrendient on the grocery list page.

### Feature 7
Recieved little feedback due to lack tests. Therefore we will focus on more cucumber and JUnit tests for this feature because we believe it is working properly.

### Feature 8
Need more cucumber tests for the feature especially edge cases. Also will create a test for a specific search with a specific radius and make sure we get the right results.
