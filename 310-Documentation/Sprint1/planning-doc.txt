## Why did we chose the subset of the product backlog to work on?

We wanted to break the sprints into work sessions of 4 tasks for the first two and leave the last sprint for revisions and polishing. These 4 tasks (1, 2, 4, and 8) seemed like the most amibguous, and therefore we chose them get the longest head start on future revisions. We also included 5 in Sprint 1 without making any changes to the front-end from Project 1 to see if the existing frontend appearance would satisfy the stakeholders' aesthetic needs.
