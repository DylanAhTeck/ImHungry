Ankur Rastogi and Andy Yalung

### Description of Tasks and Division of Labor
Andy and Ankur worked on setting up the tests for registering a user and updating a user's information using Firebase. We also started implementing the database functionality as well. Ankur was primarly typing but both were working off the same machine. Occasionally the two swapped back and forth for smaller portions of code.

_Note: We accidentally squashed and merged when working on branches here and so teh test and code commits became one commit. We'll be careful not to do this in the future._
